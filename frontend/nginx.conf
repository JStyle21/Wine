  # Optional: You can add a location block to proxy API requests
  # if you want the frontend Nginx to handle API proxying.
  # However, with Docker Compose, it's often cleaner to have the browser
  # call the backend service directly or via a main reverse proxy on the VM.
  # Example for proxying /api requests:
  # location /api {
  #   proxy_pass http://backend:5001; # Assuming 'backend' is the service name of your backend container
  #   proxy_set_header Host $host;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  # }
